# Deep Learning Project - Spaceship Titanic

The Spaceship Titanic challenge from Kaggle is a binary classification problem where the goal is to predict whether passengers were transported to another dimension. This project was developed as a way to practice and apply what I've been learning about Artificial Intelligence.

## Project Structure  

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Data preparation steps, including handling outliers, missing values, and feature engineering.  
2. **Data Improvement** – Feature selection and semi-supervised learning technique to enhance the training dataset.  
3. **Deep Learning** – Training a neural network with PyTorch, performing hyperparameter tuning and making predictions.

I'm very happy to have completed this project, as it allowed me to practice and learn more about Deep Learning and techniques to improve model performance.

Thanks!
